# Financial Transaction Processor

A PHP-based tool to process financial transactions with VAT adjustments and compound interest calculations.

## Key Features
- **Transaction Processing**: Handles credits/debits with category-specific VAT (5% for goods/services)
- **Precision Accounting**: Ensures 2-decimal rounding at every calculation stage
- **Dynamic UI**: Interactive form for adding/removing transactions
- **Session Management**: Prevents duplicate form submissions

## Code Style Highlights
- **Structured Logic**: Separates business logic (`processTransactions`) from presentation
- **Defensive Checks**: Validates inputs, skips invalid transactions
- **Explicit Rounding**: Uses `round()` for calculations + `number_format()` for display
- **Clean OOP-ish Approach**: Functions mimic class methods without over-engineering

## Usage
1. Run on any PHP-enabled server
(or to run it local just download XAMPP then put index.php inside folder e.g.,transaction_processor then run it on: http://localhost/transaction_processor/index.php)
2. Add transactions (amount, type, category)
3. Set years/rates
4. View results (net balance, final balance, category breakdown)
